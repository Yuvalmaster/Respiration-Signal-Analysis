## Project Description
The project aims to analyze and process physiological signals to extract meaningful information and gain insights into human health and well-being. 
- Respiration Analysis:
The Respiration Analysis project focuses on the analysis of human respiration using spirometry and pneumographic data, along with video data. 
The project aims to analyze pulmonary volumes and capacities, including average lung volumes and capacities across different demographics such as sex, age, 
weight, and height. Additionally, the analysis is performed during both high pulse rate and relaxed conditions, allowing for a comprehensive understanding of 
respiratory dynamics and their variations in different physiological states.
