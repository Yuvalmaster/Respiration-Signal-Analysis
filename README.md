# Respiration Signal Analysis ü´Å

## Project Overview
The Respiration Analysis project aim to quantify and analyze pulmonary volumes and capacities, by collected and analyzed spirometry and pneumographic data along with video recordings, to gain valuable insights into the respiratory system's functioning and its variations based on key factors and physiological conditions.

## Data Collection and Analysis
The project involves several key steps for data collection and analysis:

* Spirometry and Pneumographic Data: Spirometry measurements are used to assess lung function and measure pulmonary volumes and capacities. Pneumographic data provides additional information about respiratory patterns and dynamics. These data sources are combined to obtain comprehensive respiratory measurements.

* Demographic Analysis: The project examines how pulmonary volumes and capacities vary between several subjects with different sex, age, weight, and height. By analyzing these variations, it can provide insights on the impact of these factors on respiratory function and lung health.

* Condition Analysis: The analysis is performed under different physiological conditions, including both high pulse rate and relaxed states. This allows exploration regarding respiratory dynamics change under different levels of physiological stress and relaxation, providing insights into the adaptability and response of the respiratory system.
